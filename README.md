# Simple JS Projects 🎉
This file contains some simple JS projects I made during my journey to learn JS. <br> Here's the description of all the projects:

### Project 1: Background Color Changing 🎨
This project features a few various colored container boxes, and when you click on one, the backdrop color changes to match the box's color. Employed a basic DOM idea to do this.

### Project 2: Body Mass Index (B.M.I.) Calculator 🧮
Your height, weight, and other inputs are entered into this project, and your BMI is then calculated. Additionally, it comes with a booklet that explains your BMI. Event listeners and DOM ideas have been applied to forms by me.

### Project 3: Drum Kit Page 🥁
With this project, you may play drum kits that sound like real drums by clicking on them or pressing the key that corresponds to them. What a great project this is!
